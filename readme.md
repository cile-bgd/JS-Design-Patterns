# Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript

## Pluralsight course by Jonathan Mills

### Thoroughly enjoyed this course and I learned a ton

Writing "bad" JavaScript is easy. Fortunately, writing "good" JavaScript is not too much harder. In this course, I will show you tried and true design patterns to help structure and organize your code to make your JavaScript code more readable and maintainable. I will walk you through the different ways to work with and manipulate objects in JavaScript. We will look at the tried and true gang of four design patterns and how to implement those patterns in JavaScript and AngularJS.
